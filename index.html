        <h1>Whales of the Arctic</h1>
        <img class="mainpic" src ="images/arctic.jpg" alt="Arctic with clear sky" width=90%/>
        <p id="home_caption"> The Artic is home to seventeen species of whales. During the summer, this includes whales back from 
            lengthy migrations, such as the gray, blue, fin, and minke whales. However, a fascinating trio-the bowhead, 
            beluga, and narwhal—make their home in the Arctic and subarctic year round.</p>
        
        <h2>Whale Classifications</h2>

        <p>Whales have two classifications—baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales include blue, 
            bowhead, fin, grey, humpback, minke, and sei whales. Toothed whales include beluga, narwhal, pilot, orca 
            (‘killer whales”), and sperm whales. Fun Fact! Dolphins and Porpoises are also classified under Baleen whales.</p> 

        <p>Instead of teeth, Baleen whales have baleen plates which hang down from the roof of the mouth and are used to 
            filter food. After taking a mouthful of water containing tiny plankton prey, they close their mouths to trap the food, 
            then they use their tongues to push the water out through these several hundred flexible fringed plates. Baleen whales 
            have two blowholes through which they breathe. Toothed whales, however, have teeth instead of baleens 
            and they only have one blowhole for breathing. These whales are hunters, so they source and capture larger prey 
            (like fish, squid, starfish, and crabs) with their teeth, usually swallowing their food whole.</p>
