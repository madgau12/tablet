        <h1>Fun Facts!</h1>
        <div id="ffacts">

            <p id="odd" class="long">Humpbacks whales have long “pectoral” fins and vary in colour, ranging from black to grey to white to mottled, 
            often with distinctive white patches on the underside of their tails. Each humpback’s markings are totally unique, 
            much like fingerprints!</p>
    
            <p id="even" class="one">One of the most unique characteristics of Gray whales is their feeding habits. Unlike other baleen whales, 
            grays are predominantly bottom feeders, which means they forage along the ocean floor.</p>
    
            <p id="odd" class="two">Narwhals and Belugas share many biological and ecological characteristics: 
            they're usually found in groups, they're quite vocal, and they have a similar diet.</p>
    
            <p id="even" id="three">Beluga Whales can turn their necks in all directions, unlike other whale species and are also
            the smallest species of whale.</p>
    
            <p id="odd" class="long">Using an electron microscope, marine mammal researchers determined that about 10 million nerve endings 
                tunnel from the core to the outer surface of a narwhal's tusk. That makes the tusk an incredible sensory 
                device, possibly capable of detecting slight changes in temperature, pressure, and much more.</p>

            <p id="even" class="one">The bowhead got its name because its upper jaw has some resemblance to an archer’s bow. Its head is immense, 
            making up about one-third of its body length.</p>

            <p id="odd" class="two">The Bowhead whale's exceptionally strong triangularly shaped skull lets it break through a foot (
            30 cm) or more of ice to breathe.</p>

            <p id="even" class="three">A narwhal tusk sells for several thousand U.S. dollars, while a rare skull with double tusks can cost 
            $30,000 to $50,000, and sometimes even more.</p>
